"HD Visa"""
Welcome to HDVisa-Thailand.com!
Founded in 2003 by Herbert,
HDVisa-Thailand.com
began as the first organized and guided
Border Bounces
from Koh Samui, providing a much-needed service to foreigners needing to renew their visa stamps. These border trips, originally designed to help travelers maintain their legal status in Thailand, quickly became popular. Herbert's expertise and knowledge of the visa process made it easy for expatriates and tourists to navigate the sometimes complex and evolving Thai immigration laws.
The Evolution of HDVisa
In 2006, significant changes were made to Thai immigration law, which spurred Herbert to adapt and offer even more streamlined services for travelers. At that time, he realized the need for a legal solution that would allow foreigners to obtain
valid visas
for extended stays in Thailand. Through extensive research, Herbert discovered the
Thai consulate in Kota Bharu
, Malaysia, a location less known at the time compared to the Penang consulate, which became a pivotal destination for those needing visa services.
Launching Weekly Services
In December 2006, Herbert launched a
weekly service
that catered to all foreigners wishing to stay legally in Thailand. The service provided guided trips to the consulate in
Kota Bharu
, offering an efficient and reliable way to obtain the necessary visas. These trips were particularly beneficial for expatriates and long-term travelers who wished to remain in Thailand without the hassle of frequent visa runs or confusion about the ever-changing regulations.
Exploring New Areas
In the early days of the service, the trips took travelers through areas that were considered
non-tourist
regions, including districts such as
Pattani
,
Narathiwat
, and
Songkhla
. These locations were relatively unknown to tourists, which added an element of adventure and discovery for those taking the guided trips. Despite the uncertainty about the destination, Herbert's service continued to gain trust and recognition as a reliable solution for visa renewals.
Why Choose HDVisa?
Expertise
: With over 20 years of experience in the visa industry,
HDVisa-Thailand.com

"Samui Float Centre"""
Zero Gravity Zero Stress
At our Floatation center on Koh Samui; state-of-the-art floatation tanks and the comfortable feeling they provide enable you to truly unplug and disconnect; blocking out all visual, audio, and tactile distractions.
Floating, also known as floatation therapy or Sensory deprivation therapy, is a form of relaxation technique that involves floating in a tank or pod filled with water,  heated to skin temperature and with a high concentration of Epsom salt which makes the body float effortlessly.
This allows the individual to experience a sense of weightlessness and complete relaxation, as there is no pressure on the joints or muscles. The soundproof and lightproof environment also eliminates external stimuli, allowing the individual to focus on their inner thoughts and sensations and provides a unique environment that can help promote relaxation, reduce stress, and enhance physical and mental wellbeing.
Float therapy has gained popularity in recent years as a holistic approach to wellness, with many people reporting benefits such as reduced stress, improved sleep quality, enhanced creativity, and relief from physical pain. While float therapy may not be for everyone, it is a unique experience that can help individuals disconnect from the stress and distractions of everyday life and promote relaxation and overall wellbeing.

"Nanny Service Koh Samui"""
When planning your family holiday in Koh Samui, it's crucial to book early—especially during peak times. Our nannies are in high demand and tend to book out quickly, so securing your personal nanny well in advance ensures you don't miss out. By inquiring early, you'll also be able to have the same nanny for the duration of your stay, allowing for consistency and comfort for your child/children.
Our nannies are happy to travel with you around the island, and often know of hidden local spots for you to explore. Whether you're relaxing by the pool at your villa or out and about, your nanny will take care of all your childcare needs, allowing you to truly unwind and enjoy your holiday.
If you'd like the nanny to travel with you to nearby islands like Koh Tao or Koh Phangan, they are usually available for that too—just cover her expenses off the island and a small “away from home” allowance of 1000 baht per day.

"Sadanan Acupuncture & Wellness"""
Effective acupuncture and cupping therapy treatments for various conditions causing discomfort and pain. Common symptoms like neck, shoulder, and back pain, wrist discomfort, and fatigue can be relieved with acupuncture and cupping. Acupuncture promotes pain relief through endorphin release, reduces muscle tension, and enhances circulation, while cupping therapy helps increase blood flow, reduce muscle stiffness, and alleviate pain.
Both therapies also alleviate stress, improve posture, and address the root causes of discomfort. Regular sessions can manage chronic symptoms and improve overall well-being. For tailored care, consult with a qualified practitioner at Sadanan Acupuncture & Wellness today.

"Happy Tails Sanctuary"""
When I first arrived in Koh Samui, Thailand, from Europe many years ago, I quickly felt a calling to help the street dogs and cats. Many of them were living in harsh conditions—struggling to survive on the streets, injured, sick, or abandoned at my doorstep.
From the moment I took in the first dog, I knew I was going to dedicate my life to their care. Rather than sending them to a shelter, I chose to open my own home to these animals, offering them a safe place and a promise to provide for them for the rest of their lives.
Today, around 57 dogs and 38 cats call the sanctuary their home, each with a unique and often heartbreaking story. In addition to the animals in our care, we also tend to street dogs in our area, providing medical treatments and ensuring their basic needs are met.
We do not receive any government funding, so every form of support is essential for us to continue our work. Whether through sponsoring a dog or cat, making donations, volunteering on-site, sharing our message, or other ways, your help makes all the difference. None of this would be possible without your generous support!

"Psylo"""
Born from a real need – the need for clothing that reflects the adventurous, free-spirited lifestyles of global travelers, tribal explorers, surfers, dancers, and those seeking new experiences. As founders of Psylo, we realized that the men’s and women’s clothing available at the time did not truly express the dynamic and bold lives we were living. That’s why we set out to create something unique: clothing that blends style, function, and personal expression.
With a focus on sustainable fashion, ethnic-inspired designs, and comfortable yet durable materials, Psylo’s collections cater to individuals who live life on their own terms. Our clothing is designed to move with you, from the beach to the dance floor, from the road to the city streets, offering a distinctive look that speaks to both adventure and self-expression.
We refuse to be defined by ordinary fashion, crafting pieces that are as unique and diverse as the people who wear them.

"Nature Jewelry"""
In ancient times, shamans, priests, and healers harnessed the power of crystals and stones for protection and healing. Today, their power and beauty continue to have a profound effect on all who come in contact with them.
Crystals are pure energy that sparkle and call out, inviting you to experience their healing effects. Known for their ability to lift spirits, heal the body, and open chakras, these natural wonders help clear auras, improve memory, repel electromagnetic emissions, and support personal growth. Each stone carries its own unique energy, waiting to support you on your journey.
Created by Micha and Shai, our collection of unique crystal jewelry combines beauty with healing properties. With a deep love and understanding of the power of crystals, Micha and Shai are dedicated to sharing their knowledge and educating the public about the transformative qualities of stones. Through their creations, they aim to bring the healing power of crystals to you, offering pieces that are not only stunning but also deeply nourishing for the mind, body, and soul.

"Samui Lost Souls Scooter Club"""
Cruising around Samui on a Vespa or another classic scooter? That’s how the Samui Lost Souls Scooter Club rolls — with chrome shining, engines humming, and the spirit of freedom in the air.
This isn’t your average club. It’s a crew of scooter lovers, retro rebels, and laid-back legends keeping the mod culture alive while exploring the island together. From vintage Vespas to stylish customs, it’s all about the look, the sound, and the lifestyle.
The club hosts regular ride-outs around Samui — not just for fun (though they are a blast), but as a way to connect, share stories, and show off a bit. Guided scooter tours take in stunning coastlines, secret backroads, temples, bars, and sunset spots only the locals know.
There’s always a good mix of people: Thai, expat, long-time residents, and the occasional curious tourist tagging along. What they all share is a love for scooters, a cold drink at the end of the ride, and a laugh along the way.
No pressure, no politics — just good company, great views, and the sound of classic engines echoing through the hills.
Find them online, join a ride, or just give a thumbs up when you see the convoy pass by. You’ll know it when you feel it — that’s the Lost Souls vibe.

"Lamai Residence"""
Ultimate Convenience Meets Luxury Living
Just 20 meters from Windfield International School, this location is unmatched for families, expats, and investors seeking a refined lifestyle with strong investment potential. The area offers not just a home, but an opportunity to live or invest in one of Koh Samui’s most desirable and future-proof neighborhoods.
High Demand for Family-Friendly Housing
With over 600 children enrolled, Windfield International is a top choice for expat families, driving strong rental demand in the area. Parents prefer living nearby for convenience, making it ideal for long-term leases and stable rental income. Spacious, secure homes in well-connected areas are consistently in demand.
Strong Rental Yields & Investment Opportunity
Properties in this zone typically achieve annual rental yields of 8–14%. The presence of long-term tenants such as expat families offers consistent income and less turnover compared to short-term holiday rentals. Limited land supply near premium schools also drives property appreciation.
Close to Key Amenities & Infrastructure
Supermarkets like Lotus and Makro, hospitals, cafés, fitness centers, and good road networks are all within easy reach. Bophut, Fisherman’s Village, and Chaweng Beach are just a short drive away, offering lifestyle perks and convenience.
Safe, Upscale Neighborhood
The surrounding area is peaceful, secure, and known for its luxury villas and gated communities. It offers a quieter alternative to central tourist zones while remaining well-connected — ideal for families and high-end tenants.
Resale Value & Long-Term Growth
Proximity to a major international school ensures lasting value. As Koh Samui’s expat population grows, demand for quality family housing is set to increase. With limited prime land available, properties here offer excellent capital appreciation.

"Phensiri Thai Restaurant"""
Welcome to a return to the roots of Thai Cuisine, where every dish tells a story deeply rooted in Samui’s rich culinary heritage. Founded by Chef Santi Wongsawat, a native of the island, Phensiri honors time-honored southern Thai recipes while embracing a commitment to health, sustainability, and authenticity.
At Phensiri, we cook with intention. Our kitchen uses only what nature offers fresh each day — locally grown herbs, responsibly sourced seafood, and tropical produce from the Samui archipelago. We avoid industrial ingredients, opting instead for natural alternatives like coconut oil and traditional animal fats that have nourished generations.
Chef Santi’s journey began in his mother’s kitchen, where he learned the secrets of southern Thai flavors and the importance of balance and technique. Today, that legacy lives on in every dish, from vibrant curries enriched with mature coconuts to delicate desserts made with the subtle sweetness of young ones. Each meal is a tribute to the island’s bounty and the wisdom of its culinary traditions.
