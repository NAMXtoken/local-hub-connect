These border trips, originally designed to help travelers maintain their legal status in Thailand, quickly became popular. Herbert's expertise and knowledge of the visa process made it easy for expatriates and tourists to navigate the sometimes complex and evolving Thai immigration laws.
The Evolution of HDVisa
In 2006, significant changes were made to Thai immigration law, which spurred Herbert to adapt and offer even more streamlined services for travelers. At that time, he realized the need for a legal solution that would allow foreigners to obtain
valid visas
for extended stays in Thailand. Through extensive research, Herbert discovered the
Thai consulate in Kota Bharu
, Malaysia, a location less known at the time compared to the Penang consulate, which became a pivotal destination for those needing visa services.
Launching Weekly Services
In December 2006, Herbert launched a
weekly service
that catered to all foreigners wishing to stay legally in Thailand. The service provided guided trips to the consulate in
Kota Bharu
, offering an efficient and reliable way to obtain the necessary visas. These trips were particularly beneficial for expatriates and long-term travelers who wished to remain in Thailand without the hassle of frequent visa runs or confusion about the ever-changing regulations.
Exploring New Areas
In the early days of the service, the trips took travelers through areas that were considered
non-tourist
regions, including districts such as
Pattani
,
Narathiwat
, and
Songkhla
. These locations were relatively unknown to tourists, which added an element of adventure and discovery for those taking the guided trips. Despite the uncertainty about the destination, Herbert's service continued to gain trust and recognition as a reliable solution for visa renewals.

At our Floatation center on Koh Samui; state-of-the-art floatation tanks and the comfortable feeling they provide enable you to truly unplug and disconnect; blocking out all visual, audio, and tactile distractions.
Floating, also known as floatation therapy or Sensory deprivation therapy, is a form of relaxation technique that involves floating in a tank or pod filled with water,  heated to skin temperature and with a high concentration of Epsom salt which makes the body float effortlessly.
This allows the individual to experience a sense of weightlessness and complete relaxation, as there is no pressure on the joints or muscles. The soundproof and lightproof environment also eliminates external stimuli, allowing the individual to focus on their inner thoughts and sensations and provides a unique environment that can help promote relaxation, reduce stress, and enhance physical and mental wellbeing.
Float therapy has gained popularity in recent years as a holistic approach to wellness, with many people reporting benefits such as reduced stress, improved sleep quality, enhanced creativity, and relief from physical pain.

Many of them were living in harsh conditions—struggling to survive on the streets, injured, sick, or abandoned at my doorstep.
From the moment I took in the first dog, I knew I was going to dedicate my life to their care. Rather than sending them to a shelter, I chose to open my own home to these animals, offering them a safe place and a promise to provide for them for the rest of their lives.
Today, around 57 dogs and 38 cats call the sanctuary their home, each with a unique and often heartbreaking story. In addition to the animals in our care, we also tend to street dogs in our area, providing medical treatments and ensuring their basic needs are met.
We do not receive any government funding, so every form of support is essential for us to continue our work. Whether through sponsoring a dog or cat, making donations, volunteering on-site, sharing our message, or other ways, your help makes all the difference.

At Phensiri, we cook with intention. Our kitchen uses only what nature offers fresh each day — locally grown herbs, responsibly sourced seafood, and tropical produce from the Samui archipelago. We avoid industrial ingredients, opting instead for natural alternatives like coconut oil and traditional animal fats that have nourished generations.
Chef Santi’s journey began in his mother’s kitchen, where he learned the secrets of southern Thai flavors and the importance of balance and technique. Today, that legacy lives on in every dish, from vibrant curries enriched with mature coconuts to delicate desserts made with the subtle sweetness of young ones.
